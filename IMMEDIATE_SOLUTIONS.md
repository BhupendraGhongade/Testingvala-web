# IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS FOR RATE LIMIT

## Issue Identified
- **Supabase has 3 emails/hour per email address limit**
- **30 emails/hour per IP address limit**
- This is BEFORE reaching ZeptoMail
- Error: `x-sb-error-code: over_email_send_rate_limit`

## SOLUTION 1: Clear Rate Limit (Quick Fix)
Run `fix-supabase-rate-limit.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

## SOLUTION 2: Use Different Emails for Testing
Each email address has separate rate limit:
- test1@example.com
- test2@example.com  
- test3@example.com

## SOLUTION 3: Wait 1 Hour
Rate limits reset every hour.

## SOLUTION 4: Custom Email Service (Permanent Fix)
Use `custom-email-service.js` to bypass Supabase completely.

## SOLUTION 5: Contact Supabase Support
Request rate limit increase for your project:
- Project ID: qxsardezvxsquvejvsso
- Request: Increase email rate limits for development

## RECOMMENDED ACTION
1. Run the SQL fix first
2. Test with different email addresses
3. If still blocked, implement custom email service

The issue is NOT with ZeptoMail - it's Supabase's built-in protection.
