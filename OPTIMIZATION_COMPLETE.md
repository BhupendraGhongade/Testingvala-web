import { unifiedDataService } from './services/unifiedDataService';
const data = await unifiedDataService.loadPageData('community', userRole, userId);
```

**"Cache not working"**
```javascript
// Clear and restart cache
unifiedDataService.clearAllCaches();
```

**"Performance monitor not showing"**
```javascript
// Ensure AdminPerformancePanel is included
<AdminPerformancePanel />
```
