# 🧹 Upcoming Events Layout Cleanup

## ❌ **Issue Identified**
The Upcoming Events section had a "dirty" and scattered layout:
- **3-column grid**: Made content feel disconnected and spread out
- **Large spacing**: Too much empty space between elements
- **Oversized elements**: Countdown timer and image were too large
- **Poor organization**: Information felt scattered rather than cohesive
- **Unprofessional appearance**: Layout didn't look business-ready

## ✅ **Clean Layout Fix Applied**

### **🎯 Layout Restructuring**
- **Changed from 3-column grid to 2-column flex layout**
- **Compact design**: Reduced padding and spacing throughout

#### **3. Event Image (Right Column)**
**Before:**
- Large image container (h-64, w-full)
- Oversized fallback icon
- Too much padding

**After:**
- ✅ **Compact image**: Fixed size (w-48 h-48)
