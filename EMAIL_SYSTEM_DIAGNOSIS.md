# EMAIL SYSTEM DIAGNOSIS - FOUND THE ISSUE!

## Problem: Multiple Email Systems Conflicting

You have 3 different email systems running:

### 1. Supabase Built-in Email (What you're updating)
- Location: Supabase Dashboard → Auth → Email Templates
- Status: ❌ NOT BEING USED
- Why: Overridden by webhook system

### 2. Custom Webhook System (What's actually sending emails)
- File: `supabase-webhook.sql` 
- Trigger: `on_auth_user_created`
- Sends to: `http://localhost:3001/send-magic-link`
- Status: ✅ ACTIVE (This is sending your old emails)

### 3. ZeptoMail SMTP Server
- File: `email-service/server.js`
- Port: 3001
- Status: ✅ ACTIVE

## THE FIX

You need to update the email template in your **webhook server**, not Supabase dashboard.

### Option 1: Update Webhook Server Template
Update `email-service/server.js` line 25-35 with your new template.

### Option 2: Disable Webhook, Use Supabase
1. Remove the trigger:
```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS on_auth_user_created ON auth.users;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS send_magic_link_webhook();
```
2. Configure Supabase SMTP settings
3. Then your dashboard templates will work

## IMMEDIATE ACTION
Check if your email service is running:
```bash
cd email-service && npm start
```

If it's running, that's why you get old templates!
