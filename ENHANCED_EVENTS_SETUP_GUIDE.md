# Enhanced Events System Setup Guide

## üöÄ **Overview**

This guide will help you set up the enhanced events system for your TestingVala website, including:
- Enhanced database structure with comprehensive event data
- Image upload functionality using Supabase Storage
- Professional event management interface
- Clean, organized dashboard layout

## üìã **Prerequisites**

- Supabase project set up and running
- Admin access to your Supabase dashboard
- Basic understanding of SQL and database management

## üóÑÔ∏è **Database Setup**

### 1. Run the Enhanced Events SQL Script

Execute the `setup-enhanced-events.sql` script in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- This will create the enhanced events table with all necessary fields
-- and insert comprehensive dummy data for testing
```

### 2. Verify Table Creation

Check that the following table was created:
- `upcoming_events` - Main events table with enhanced structure

### 3. Verify Views Creation

The script creates these helpful views:
- `featured_events` - Shows only featured events
- `upcoming_events_30_days` - Shows events in the next 30 days

## üñºÔ∏è **Storage Setup**

### 1. Create Storage Bucket

In your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to **Storage** ‚Üí **Buckets**
2. Click **Create a new bucket**
3. Set bucket name: `event-images`
4. Set bucket as **Public**
5. Click **Create bucket**

### 2. Configure Storage Policies

Create a policy for the `event-images` bucket:

```sql
-- Allow public read access to event images
CREATE POLICY "Public Access" ON storage.objects FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'event-images');

-- Allow authenticated users to upload images
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload" ON storage.objects FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'event-images' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Allow authenticated users to update their images
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own images" ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE USING (bucket_id = 'event-images' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Allow authenticated users to delete their images
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own images" ON storage.objects FOR DELETE USING (bucket_id = 'event-images' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```
