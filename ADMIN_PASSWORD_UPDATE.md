# üîí ADMIN PASSWORD UPDATE REQUIRED

## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE

Your admin panel currently uses a **hardcoded password** that needs to be changed before production deployment.

## üìç CURRENT SITUATION

**File**: `/Testingvala-admin/src/components/WebsiteAdminPanel.jsx`
**Current Password**: `Golu@2205` (visible in code)
**Security Risk**: HIGH - Anyone with code access can login as admin

## üîß MANUAL STEPS REQUIRED

### **Step 1: Choose New Secure Password**
Create a strong password with:
- 12+ characters
- Mix of uppercase/lowercase
- Numbers and symbols
- Example: `TvAdmin2025!@#$`

### **Step 2: Find Admin Login Code**
Look for the admin login component that checks the password `Golu@2205`

### **Step 3: Update Password**
Replace `Golu@2205` with your new secure password

### **Step 4: Test Admin Access**
1. Go to your website
2. Click settings icon (bottom right)
3. Enter NEW password
4. Verify admin panel opens

## üéØ RECOMMENDED APPROACH

**Better Security**: Instead of hardcoded password, use:
1. Environment variable for password
2. Encrypted password storage
3. Session-based authentication

## ‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE PRODUCTION

- [ ] Change admin password
- [ ] Test new password works
- [ ] Document new password securely
- [ ] Consider implementing better auth system

**DO NOT deploy to production with the current password!**
