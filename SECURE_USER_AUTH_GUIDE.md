# 🔒 SECURE USER-SIDE AUTHENTICATION GUIDE

## 🎯 PRODUCTION-SAFE SOLUTION FOR USER FEATURES

This setup enables secure authentication for user features (create post, pinned, save, boards, resume) that works identically in development and production.

### ✅ FEATURES PROTECTED:

### 🚀 HOW TO TEST LOCALLY:

1. **Start your app:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Use Quick Auth (top-right corner):**
   - Click "User Login" for regular user features
   - Click "Admin Login" for admin features
   - Click "Sign Out" to test unauthenticated state

3. **Test Protected Features:**
   - Try creating a post → Should work after login
   - Try pinning posts → Should work after login
   - Try accessing boards → Should work after login
   - Try resume builder → Should work after login
