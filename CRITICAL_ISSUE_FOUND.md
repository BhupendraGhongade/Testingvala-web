# üö® CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND: ZeptoMail Sandbox Mode

## The Problem
Your ZeptoMail is in **SANDBOX MODE** - this severely limits email delivery!

## What Sandbox Mode Does:
- ‚ùå Blocks emails to external recipients
- ‚ùå Only allows emails to verified addresses
- ‚ùå Prevents magic link delivery to real users
- ‚úÖ Only works for testing with pre-approved emails

## Immediate Fix Required:

### Step 1: Exit Sandbox Mode
1. In ZeptoMail dashboard, look for "Sandbox mode" toggle
2. **DISABLE sandbox mode**
3. This will allow emails to any recipient

### Step 2: Verify Domain Status
1. Go to "Domains" section in ZeptoMail
2. Ensure `testingvala.com` is fully verified
3. Check DNS records are properly configured

### Step 3: Add Test Email to Verified List (Temporary)
If you can't exit sandbox immediately:
1. Go to ZeptoMail ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Verified Emails
2. Add your test email address
3. Verify it through the confirmation email

## Why This Explains Everything:
- ‚úÖ SMTP connection works (we tested successfully)
- ‚úÖ Supabase configuration is correct
- ‚ùå ZeptoMail sandbox blocks delivery to unverified emails
- ‚ùå Magic links fail silently in sandbox mode

## Production Requirements:
- Domain must be verified
- Sandbox mode must be disabled
- SPF/DKIM records must be configured

This is definitely the issue! Sandbox mode is preventing email delivery.
