## 📊 DATA MANAGEMENT STRATEGY

### **🔄 HOW DATA FLOWS**

**Local Development (Your Computer):**
```
You code → Local database → Test safely → No risk to real data
```

**Production Deployment (Live Website):**
```
You finish coding → Safe deployment script → Production database → Users see updates
```

### **💾 BACKUP STRATEGY**

**Automatic Backups:**
- ✅ **Supabase:** Daily backups for 7 days (free tier)
- ✅ **Code:** Git repository backups
- ✅ **Deployment:** Vercel keeps deployment history

**Manual Backups (Before Major Changes):**
```bash
# Run this before big updates
bash safe-deployment-workflow.sh
# This creates a backup automatically
```

### **🚨 DATA LOSS PREVENTION**

**What Protects Your Data:**
1. **Supabase Free Tier Protections:**
   - 7-day point-in-time recovery
   - Daily automated backups
   - 99.9% uptime guarantee

2. **Our Additional Protections:**
   - CLI unlinked (prevents accidents)
   - Environment separation
   - Safe deployment scripts
   - Daily safety checks

3. **Emergency Recovery:**
   - Can restore from any backup
   - Can rollback deployments
   - Can recover deleted data (within 7 days)
